        <h1>Dave Winfield</h1>
        <p>David Mark "Dave" Winfield (born October 3, 1951) is an American former Major League Baseball
            (MLB) right fielder. He is currently special assistant to the executive director of the Major
            League Baseball Players Association. Over his 22-year career, he played for six teams: the San
            Diego Padres, New York Yankees, California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, and
            Cleveland Indians. In 2004, ESPN named him the third-best all-around athlete of all time in
            any sport. He is a member of both the Baseball Hall of Fame and the College Baseball Hall of
            Fame. </p>
        <p>Winfield was born the same day Bobby Thomson hit his pennant-winning home run for the
            New York Giants, known as "the shot heard 'round the world". He grew up in St. Paul,
            Minnesota. His parents divorced when he was three years old, leaving him and his older
            brother Stephen to be raised by their mother, Arline, and a large extended family of aunts,
            uncles, grandparents and cousins. The Winfield brothers honed their athletic skills in
            St. Paul's Oxford playground, where coach Bill Peterson was one of the first to take the young
            Winfield under his wing. Winfield did not become a formidable 6'6" athlete until his senior year
            of high school. He earned a full baseball scholarship to the University of Minnesota in 1969
            , where he starred in baseball and basketball for the Golden Gophers. His college baseball
            coach was former MLB player Dick Siebert. His basketball coach was Bill Musselman, who was
            later a head coach in the American Basketball Association and National Basketball
            Association and who later referred to Winfield as the best rebounder he ever coached.
            Winfield's 1972 Minnesota team won a Big Ten basketball championship, the school's first
            in 53 years. During the 1972 season, he also was involved in a brawl when Minnesota played
            Ohio State.</p>
