    <p>NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — There are three ways oil futures could find a floor and halt an accelerating
        collapse that has sent prices to 5 1/2 year lows in the sharpest selloff since the financial crisis of 2008. but there’s
        no sign any of the three are about to materialize, say strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>

     <p>The three elements won’t come as a major surprise to anyone following the oil situation. To find a floor the market would
        need to see production cuts by countries outside of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, output cuts by
        OPEC itself, or stronger global demand, wrote B.of A. commodity strategist Francisco Blanch and colleagues in a note
        distributed Tuesday.</p>
